# TasteTracker-Frontend

## Overview
Looking to try out new, exotic and/or healthy recipes, but don't want to guess at where all the different herbs, spices, and specialty ingredients are in your area? Well, with TasteTracker, you can precisely locate where all these ingredients are without having to take a shot in the dark. TasteTracker takes your recipe lists and populates the store(s) or other locations that carry your list items on the app's "Near Me" map, so you know exactly where to go to find them. Making new recipes doesn't have to be so daunting with TasteTracker leading you onto the next recipe you've been dying to try out!

# TasteTracker

## TasteTracker-Frontend
1. Have a landing homepage where clients can learn about the app and navigate website (once they're registered and logged-in)
2. Register/login to use app's features
3. Create organized, helpful lists with specifying descriptions to a "My List" page
4. Use "Near Me" map feature to locate list items


## MVP:
- Can create an account so that:
  - Users can create recipe lists in the "My Lists" page
  - Users can edit their list names as needed
  - Users can delete their lists 
  - Users can add/edit descriptions to their lists
  - Users can go into a specific recipe list and add comma-delimited items/ingredients
  - Users can edit their ingredients from those lists
  - Users can remove ingredients from a specific list
  - Users can use the "Near Me"'s search bar to access lists, so that that list's items may appear on the map, at the location(s) where those items can be found with pertinent info

## Stretch Goals:
- List sharing among users
- Lists marked as product-oriented will have a special "Shopping" map feature, which will include totaled price of all list items according to the stores that they are found at
  
## Tentative Stretch Goals:
- Follow up reminders, either in-app or through some third-party service, where neglected lists send follow up reminders
- Integration with google calendar
- Chat functionality to discuss lists among users
- Social aspect where users can add friends and view their friendsâ€™ past lists for ideas


## Technical Challenges:
- Third party and API integration for frontend features
- Store(s) rendering on "Near Me" map feature, based on list items
- Storing lists and their items for users
- Having cohesive design and function amongst features of app
- Creating intuitive UI 
- Real-time updating

## Suggested Stack:
- React
- Redux Toolkit
- Babelrc
