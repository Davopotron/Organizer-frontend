# Organizer-Frontend

## Overview
Organize and tackle your activities, events, plans, projects, todos and more with Organizer, which will show you where all your needs are for your convenience! Create lists of things you need either for everyday life or elaborate projects; then the search integrated map feature will locate all your listed items, so you can plan out exactly where to go to accomplish your todos efficiently. No need to search all over the internet for various items' locations, when you can just create a list and let Organizer's integrated map feature conveniently find them for you.

# Organizer

## Organizer-Frontend
1. Have a landing homepage where clients can learn about the app and navigate website (once they're registered and logged-in)
2. Register/login to use app's features
3. Create organized, helpful lists with specifying descriptions to a "My List" page
4. Use "Near Me" map feature to locate list items
5. Use "Shopping" feature to get the price of list items (where applicable)


## MVP:
- Can create an account so that:
  - Users can create item lists in the "My Lists" page
  - Users can edit their list names as needed
  - Users can delete their lists 
  - Users can add/edit descriptions to their lists
  - Users can go into a specific list and add comma-delimited items
  - Users can edit the items from those lists
  - Users can remove items from those lists
  - Users can use the "Near Me"'s search bar to access lists, so that that list's items may appear on the map, at the location(s) where those items can be found with pertinent info
  - Users can use the "Shopping" feature to show where items are alongside their prices and totals

## Stretch Goals:
- List sharing among users
- Lists marked as product-oriented will have a special "Shopping" map feature, which will include totaled price of all list items according to the stores that they are found at
  
## Tentative Stretch Goals:
- Follow up reminders, either in-app or through some third-party service, where neglected lists send follow up reminders
- Integration with google calendar
- Chat functionality to discuss lists among users
- Social aspect where users can add friends and view their friendsâ€™ past lists for ideas


## Technical Challenges:
- Third party and API integration for frontend features
- Store(s) rendering on "Near Me" map feature, based on list items
- Storing lists and their items for users
- Having cohesive design and function amongst features of app
- Creating intuitive UI
- Integrating shopping feature to show price of all list items
- Real-time updating

## Suggested Stack:
- React
- Redux Toolkit
- Babelrc
