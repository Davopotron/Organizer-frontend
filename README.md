# Organizer


## MVP:
- Can create an account in order to:
- Users can create organized, helpful lists to accomplish needs/todo's to a "My List" page
- Users can edit their "My Lists'" names as needed
- Users can delete their lists
- Users can add/remove items from their list
- Users can edit their list items
- Users can use the "Near Me"'s search bar to access lists, so that that list's items may appear on the map, at the location(s) where those items can be found

## Technical Challenges:
- Third party integration
- Store rendering on "Near Me" map feature, based on list items


## Stretch Goals:
- List sharing among users
- Lists marked as product-oriented will have a special "Shopping" map feature, which will include totaled price of all list items according to the stores that they are found at
  
## Tentative Stretch Goals:
- Follow up reminders, either in-app or through some third-party service, where neglected lists send follow up reminders
- Integration with google calendar
- Chat functionality to discuss plans
- Social aspect where users can have add friends and view their friendsâ€™ past lists for ideas
